# Social Network Analysis using R 📊

Welcome to the Social Network Analysis repository! This project provides code snippets and functions for analyzing social networks using R programming language.

## Overview 🌟

Social network analysis (SNA) is a powerful technique to study relationships between entities represented as nodes and edges in a graph. This repository empowers you to dive into the fascinating world of network analysis, offering tools for:

- Creating and visualizing graphs 📈
- Calculating network measures such as degree, diameter, and centrality 📏
- Reading data files and constructing networks 📂
- Histogram of node degree distribution 📊
- Highlighting node degrees and layouts 🎨
- Detecting hubs and authorities 🕵️
- Community detection within networks 🌐

## Dependencies 🛠️

To unleash the potential of this repository, you'll need the following R packages:

- `igraph`: Your go-to package for graph analysis and manipulation.

You can install the required package using the following command:

```R
install.packages("igraph")
```
